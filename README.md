# NERonAGRK_experiments

This repository contains the data and code for the adaptation of a new workflow of Named Entity Recognition
and classification applied to Ancient Greek. We implemented a feature-based supervised machine learning model which is easily customizable for different
languages. This allowed the creation of a dataset of automatically classified toponyms and
ethnonyms starting from a small manually annotated list.
